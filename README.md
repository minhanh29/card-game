# card-game
This project is making a card game.
1. The player chooses a number of cards.
2. Random cards are selected and shuffled by the program.
3. The player has to memorize all the cards' names.
4. 1 random will be eliminated.
5. The player has 3 chances to answer which card was gone.

Issues:
1. Clear the screen after the player finishes memorizing.
2. Rename some cards (1S -> AS: Ace of Spade. 13H -> KH: King of Hearts)
